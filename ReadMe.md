# Market Segmentation Analysis for McDonald's

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed market segmentation analysis for McDonald's, utilizing data science techniques to understand customer segments based on their preferences and behaviors towards McDonald's offerings.

## Key Steps in the Analysis
- **Importing Modules**: Utilization of essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Data Preparation**: Loading the dataset and conducting initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting categorical data to numeric formats for analysis.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing the dimensionality of the data to capture essential features effectively.
- **Clustering with K-Means**: Implementing K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
- **Data Visualization**: Employing Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visual representations of the data and results.

## Dataset
The dataset includes responses from McDonald's customers on various attributes such as 'yummy', 'convenient', 'spicy', etc., and demographic information like 'Age', 'Visit Frequency', and 'Gender'.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, YellowBrick, Collections, Scipy, StatsModels, Itertools
